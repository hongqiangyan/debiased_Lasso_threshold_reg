This repository contains the replication material for the simulations and the empirical application in   [__"Uniform Inference for High-dimensional Threshold Regression"__](https://hongqiangyan.github.io/files/Uniform_Inference_in_High_Dimensional_Threshold_Regression_Models.pdf). All the computations are carried using *R* package for easy replication. 

The material is divided between 2 files:

 -**tlas.R** contains the code for the thresholded Lasso and the simulations. **tlastest_synth.R** contain the setup and call to *ttlas* for the experiments.
